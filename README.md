# zdesktop
Zimbra desktop wrapper to run latest browser instead of default/built-in browser with zimbra desktop application

zdesktop 7.5.2 is based on the prism code which is now 3 1/2 years out of date for the browser component. No sign of an update from Zimbra a year later although they announced as of Aug 2014 they would continue development. This wrapper allows one to create a short cut on ones desktop to bring up the zimbra desktop with your current/favorite browser.
